NAME
    CPAN::Testers::Config - Manage CPAN Testers configuration data

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.001.

SYNOPSIS
         use CPAN::Testers::Config;
     
     $config = CPAN::Testers::Config->read;
         $config->{global}{profile} = 'my_profile.json';
         $config->write;

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN::Testers::Config provides a very simple interface to load and save
    CPAN Testers configuration data using only core Perl modules.

    By default, configuration is stored in '.cpantesters/config.pl' in the
    user's home directory. Data is serialized using Data::Dumper.

SCHEMA
    No formal schema has been defined yet for CPAN Testers configuration and
    thus there is no validation by this module.

    Configuration is provided as a hash of hashes. The top-level key
    "global" is reserved for data that will be used by multiple CPAN Testers
    modules. Module-specific configuration data should be stored under a
    top-level key corresponding to the module name. For example:

       # global
       $metabase_profile = $config->{global}{profile};
     
   # module-specific
       $config->{'CPAN::Testers::Client'}{send_duplicates} = 1;

    Existing/planned global configuration keys include:

    *   "profile" -- path to a filename containing a Metabase user profile;
        if not an absolute path, it should be treated as a path relative to
        the CPAN Testers configuration directory

USAGE
  new
       $config = CPAN::Testers::Config->new( %data );

    Creates and returns a new configuration object with optional starting
    data or dies.

  read
       $config = CPAN::Tester::Config->read;
       # ... modify $config ...
       $config->read; # reload

    Returns a configuration object with data loaded from the configuration
    file or dies. May be called either as a class method or an object
    method.

  write
       $config->write;

    Serializes a configuration object to the the configuration file or dies.
    Returns the object as a convenience on success.

ENVIRONMENT
  CPAN_TESTERS_DIR
    Specifies an alternate directory to search for CPAN Testers
    configuration files instead of the default '.cpantesters' in the user's
    home directory.

  CPAN_TESTERS_CONFIG
    Specifies an alternate file for configuration data instead of
    'config.pl' in the default or alternate configuration directory.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests using the CPAN Request
    Tracker web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=CPAN-Testers-Config>

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
