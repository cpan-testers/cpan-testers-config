=head1 NAME

CPAN::Testers::Config - Manage CPAN Testers configuration data

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use CPAN::Testers::Config;
 
     $config = CPAN::Testers::Config->read;
     $config->{global}{profile} = 'my_profile.json';
     $config->write;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CPAN::Testers::Config provides a very simple interface to load and save CPAN
Testers configuration data using only core Perl modules.

By default, configuration is stored in '.cpantestersE<sol>config.pl' in the user's
home directory.  Data is serialized using L<Data::Dumper>.

=head1 SCHEMA

No formal schema has been defined yet for CPAN Testers configuration and thus there
is no validation by this module.

Configuration is provided as a hash of hashes.  The top-level key C<<< global >>> is
reserved for data that will be used by multiple CPAN Testers modules.
Module-specific configuration data should be stored under a top-level key
corresponding to the module name.  For example:

   # global
   $metabase_profile = $config->{global}{profile};
 
   # module-specific
   $config->{'CPAN::Testers::Client'}{send_duplicates} = 1;

ExistingE<sol>planned global configuration keys include:

=over

=item *

C<<< profile >>> -- path to a filename containing a Metabase user profile; if not an
absolute path, it should be treated as a path relative to the CPAN Testers 
configuration directory

=back

=head1 USAGE

=head2 new

   $config = CPAN::Testers::Config->new( %data );

Creates and returns a new configuration object with optional starting data or dies.

=head2 read

   $config = CPAN::Tester::Config->read;
   # ... modify $config ...
   $config->read; # reload

Returns a configuration object with data loaded from the configuration file or dies.
May be called either as a class method or an object method.

=head2 write

   $config->write;

Serializes a configuration object to the the configuration file or dies.
Returns the object as a convenience on success.

=head2 config_dir

   $dir = CPAN::Testers::Config->config_dir;

Return path to configuration directory.  See L</ENVIRONMENT>.

=head2 config_file

   $file = CPAN::Testers::Config->config_file;

Return path to configuration file.  See L</ENVIRONMENT>.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=head2 CPAN_TESTERS_DIR

Specifies an alternate directory to search for CPAN Testers configuration files
instead of the default '.cpantesters' in the user's home directory.

=head2 CPAN_TESTERS_CONFIG

Specifies an alternate file for configuration data instead of 'config.pl' in
